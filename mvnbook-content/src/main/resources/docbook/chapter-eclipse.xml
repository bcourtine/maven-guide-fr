  <title>Maven and Eclipse: m2eclipse</title>

  <para>This chapter is deprecated. While the original version of Maven: The
  Definitive Guide had an entire chapter dedicated to m2eclipse, Sonatype found 
  that the content was growing fast enough to deserve
  its own dedicate title. We've decided to spin off the content in the
  Eclipse chapter into a new book called <ulink
  url="${m2eclipse.book.baseurl}">${m2eclipse.book.title}</ulink>.
